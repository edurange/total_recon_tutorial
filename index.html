        <p>Total Recon is a story-based game designed to teach how network<br>protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP can be used to reveal information about<br>a network. Total Recon focuses on reconnaissance to determine hosts in an<br>unknown network. You will explore tradeoffs between speed and stealth when<br>using tools such as nmap.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Background" duration="3">
        <p>Whether you&#39;re doing a large-scale security audit, inventorying a network, or<br>analyzing network response times, nmap is a powerful tool to help you complete<br>your task. In order to understand this exercise, you should be familiar with the<br>3-way handshake for TCP. A basic understanding of ICMP and UDP will also<br>be helpful. This exercise is not designed to teach you all of the details of those<br>protocols, but rather to show you how they can be used for network exploring.<br>You will learn how to discover hosts on a network, determine which ports on<br>those hosts are open, and what applications are running on them.<br>In practice, each message that is sent over the Internet uses multiple protocols,<br>which are divided into five layers: physical layer, link layer, network layer,<br>transport layer and application layer. For example, the physical layer handles<br>what is encoded as a 0 or 1. The link layer handles communication on local area<br>networks (LANs). The network layer handles routing on wide area networks<br>(WANs), e.g. IP. The transport layer handles ports and processes, e.g. TCP,<br>UDP, ICMP. The application layer handles applications communicating with<br>each other, e.g. http, ftp, by nesting packets inside of packets. In general, these<br>packets correspond to layers of functionality: TCP is connection-oriented and is<br>responsible for a number of things including reliably conveying messages between<br>the application layers on two hosts. The three-way handshake establishes this<br>pairing with the following sequence: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK You can get a<br>summary of the important protocols and their layers in: Chapter 4 of Hacking:<br>The Art of Exploitation (Erickson)[1] or Chapter 2 of Counter Hack Reloaded<br>[2]. Network Security by Kaufman, Perlman, Speciner [3].</p>
